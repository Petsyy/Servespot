ServeSpot: Micro-Volunteering Hub for Local Communities
ServeSpot is a web-based platform designed to connect volunteers with short, flexible community service opportunities. It helps organizations and individuals easily post micro-tasks—like a 1-hour tutoring session, packing relief goods, or helping translate a flyer—while allowing volunteers to quickly browse, sign up, and track their completed activities. The system promotes civic engagement by making volunteering fast, accessible, and rewarding.
